##summary An AI leaf detection project uses machine learning to identify plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves. It can involve capturing leaf images, training a model to recognize healthy and diseased patterns, and deploying the model to diagnose potential problems. This technology helps farmers and gardeners detect issues early, potentially saving crops and improving yields.
